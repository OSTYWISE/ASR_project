        "| Beam Search | Explores multiple hypotheses (sequences of words) at each step, and keeps the 'k' most likely, where 'k' is the beam width. | **Pros:** Produces more reliable results than greedy search. <br> **Cons:** Can lack diversity and lead to generic responses. |\n",

        "| Stochastic Beam Search | Introduces randomness into the selection process of the 'k' hypotheses in beam search. | **Pros:** Increases diversity in the generated text. <br> **Cons:** The trade-off between diversity and quality can be tricky to manage. |\n",
        "| Decoding with Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) | Chooses the hypothesis (out of many) that minimizes expected loss under a loss function. | **Pros:** Optimizes the output according to a specific loss function. <br> **Cons:** Computationally more complex and requires a good loss function. |\n",
